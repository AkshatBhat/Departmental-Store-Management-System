This is my First Year Computer Engineering (Programming Methodology and Data Structures) Project based on SQLite C API.


# About
This program is supposed to be used by the Store Manager and/or the Cashier as it offers the following options:

1)CALCULATE BILL: Used by the cashier to print out the customer bill

2)ADD GOODS: Used when goods are added into the store's inventory

3)DELETE GOODS: Used when some goods are removed from the shelf(not to the customer)

4)DISPLAY ALL GOODS: Displays current inventory

5)REMOVE GOODS: Used to remove the entire shelf of a particular product

6)SEARCH GOODS: Searches goods

7)INSERT GOODS: Used to add new types of goods to the inventory


All above operations when carried out during the course of the program, reflect directly in the database file.
